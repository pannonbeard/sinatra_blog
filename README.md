# My attempts at learning Sinatra
This is more of a starter for me to try and take my RoR experience and translate it to a new (to me) framework

## Goals
- Make a blog like app 
- Utilize gems I don't normally use
  - Sequel
  - Haml
- learning Sequel - the belongs to, and has many connections
- Make Rake tasks to help generate files for Sequel
- Sinatra & Webhooks?
- Sinatra & Websockets?
- Rework into a template to start from in the future
