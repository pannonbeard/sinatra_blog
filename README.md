This is more of a starter for me to try and take my RoR experience and translate it to a new (to me) framework

## Goals
- Make a blog like app 
  - has Users
  - Users can publishes posts
  - Users can comments on posts
  - Users can like and dislikes posts / comments

- Make Rake tasks to help generate files for Sequel
- Utilize gems I don't normally use
  - Sequel
  - Haml
  - bcrypt

- learning Sequel - the many_to_one (belongs to), and one_to_many (has many) connections
